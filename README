Gravatar library for Codeigniter by Ryan Marshall

To use simply load the library as usual in your controller

$this->load->library('gravatar');

After this you can call any of the functions such as :

$this->gravatar->get_gravatar('emailhere');


The class is documented in the file, for any further help drop me a message on github or on twitter @rsmarshall

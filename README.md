Gravatar library for Codeigniter
================================

To use simply load the library as usual in your controller

    $this->load->library('gravatar');

After this you can call any of the functions such as :

    $this->gravatar->get_gravatar('emailhere');

The class is documented in the file, for any further help drop me a message on [github](https://github.com/rsmarshall) or on [twitter @rsmarshall](http://www.twitter.com/rsmarshall)
